# Android Tap to Pay Sample - original by @tedsch adapted to work in GBP

Modify the variables in vars.kt to get it to work with a different currency / server.  

Check this server instance:
https://github.com/aandresdelvalle-stripe/example-terminal-backend

For the payments backend.

* Example:

        const val LocationID = "tml_E04ONgsItef2Sz";
        const val ServerURL = "https://terminal-backend-acav.herokuapp.com/";
        const val Currency = "gbp";
        const val CountryCode = "GB";
